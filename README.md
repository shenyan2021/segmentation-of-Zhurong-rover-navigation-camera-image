This is the supporting data for the paper "Terrain classification and rock abundance analysis at Utopia Planitia using Zhurong image data based on deep learning algorithms."
All the work was done in MATLAB. Since the original image dataset exceeds 10GB and the trained deep learning model is over 1GB in size, most of the content cannot be uploaded.
This is the code for image classification, prediction, and semantic segmentation.
The Excel file named 'result.xlsx' is the classification result of 20,944 images, which is generated by the code file 'show003_2.mlx'.
